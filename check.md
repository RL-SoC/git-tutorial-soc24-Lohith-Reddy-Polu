Here are some new things I learnt after reading ``README.md``.

The ``issues`` tab can be used to show what we are currently working on in that repository.

We can star repositories to check them directly instead of searching for the repository everytime.

We can propose any changes we do by forking a open source projects by using the ``pull requests`` option.
